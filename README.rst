My collection of Python microbenchmarks written for CPython.

Benchmarks were written to make sure that a change makes CPython faster.

The code is distributed under the MIT license: see the COPYING file.

Benchmarks were written in 2016, and so mostly for CPython 3.6.

The `Python pyperf module <http://pyperf.readthedocs.io/>`_ is needed by
benchmarks. Install perf using::

    python3 -m pip install -U pyperf

Read pyperf documentation to see how to run stable benchmarks (ex: tune your
system for benchmarking).

This project is now archived and no longer maintained.
